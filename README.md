"DESCRIPTION" : Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that manipulates images by blending the artistic style of one image with the content of another. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), particularly models like VGG-19, to separate and recombine the style and content of images. The process involves three images: the content image (the subject of the final composition), the style image (the artwork or texture that dictates the aesthetics), and the generated image (the final output). NST extracts content features from deep layers of the CNN and style features from shallower layers. It then optimizes an image to maintain the structure of the content image while adopting the artistic qualities of the style image.Using loss functions, NST measures differences between content and style, iteratively adjusting pixels to achieve the desired blend. The optimization process typically uses gradient descent to fine-tune the generated image.
